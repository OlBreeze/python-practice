She closed her eyes and smiled.
A soft dream began to grow.
The night was calm and quiet.
In the dream, she walked through a forest.
The trees whispered secrets to her.
Stars above shone like tiny lights.
The dream carried her higher and higher.
She felt no fear, only peace.

A river sparkled under the moon.
The dream showed her a hidden path.
She followed the sound of music.

Birds sang in the distance.
The dream became brighter than the sky.
She touched the air and it glowed.
Mountains rose around her.
The dream whispered, “Don’t stop.”

She took a step into the light.
The ground was warm beneath her feet.
She knew the dream would end soon.

But the feeling stayed when she woke.
